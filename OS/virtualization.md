✅ What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create a virtual version of computing resources such as hardware, operating systems, storage, or networks.

🔍 In Terms of OS:

In an Operating System context, virtualization allows multiple operating systems (called guest OSes) to run on a single physical machine (host machine) by using a special layer called a hypervisor.


---

🧠 How It Works:

1. Physical Machine (Host): The actual hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.).


2. Hypervisor (Virtualization Layer):

A software that sits between hardware and OS.

It creates and manages virtual machines (VMs).



3. Virtual Machines (VMs):

Each VM has its own virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interface.

You can install a different operating system in each VM (e.g., Linux and Windows running together).

🔄 Types of Hypervisors:

Type	Description	Example

Type 1 (Bare-metal)	Runs directly on hardware	VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V
Type 2 (Hosted)	Runs on top of an existing OS	VirtualBox, VMware Workstation

Each VM is isolated, even though they share the same physical hardware.

🎯 Why Use Virtualization in OS?

Run multiple OSes on one machine

Isolate development/testing environments

Better hardware utilization

Easy backup and recovery

Fast deployment in cloud and data centers

🧪 Real Example:

A developer runs Ubuntu Linux inside Windows 10 using VirtualBox.

Cloud services like AWS use virtualization to provide on-demand virtual servers (EC2 instances).
