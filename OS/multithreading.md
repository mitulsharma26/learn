### ðŸ§µ **Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing**

| Feature        | **Multithreading**                                              | **Multiprocessing**                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Running multiple threads within a single process                | Running multiple processes independently                        |
| **Memory**     | Threads share the same memory space                             | Each process has its own memory space                           |
| **Speed**      | Faster context switching (lightweight)                          | Slower context switching (heavier)                              |
| **Use Case**   | Ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file read/write, web scraping) | Ideal for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computations, data processing) |
| **Example**    | Downloading multiple files at once                              | Running multiple instances of a program in parallel             |
| **Risk**       | Prone to race conditions and deadlocks                          | Safer due to process isolation                                  |

### In Simple Words:

* **Multithreading** is like one person doing many small tasks at once.
* **Multiprocessing** is like many people doing separate tasks at the same time.
