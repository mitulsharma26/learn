# Day 1: Terms and Buzzwords

## Language 
A language in software engineering is a formal system of communication used to write, design, or describe software.
### Purpose:
Enables humans to communicate instructions to machines in a structured and interpretable way.
### Types of Languages:
  - Low-Level Languages - is a type of programming language that is closer to how computers actually work. It directly interacts with the computer's hardware and is harder for humans to read and write.examples - 

     - Machine Language: Binary code understood directly by the CPU.

    -  Assembly Language: Human-readable mnemonics for machine instructions.
- High-Level Languages - Closer to human language; easier to write, read, and maintain (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- Object-Oriented Languages - Based on objects and classes; supports concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.Example: Java, C++, Python.
- procedural languages - Follow a step-by-step procedural approach using functions or procedures.Focus on algorithms and control flow.Use variables, loops, conditionals.Structured programming style.Examples: C, Fortran, Pascal.
- Functional Languages - Emphasizes functions, immutability, and recursion.Example: Haskell, Lisp, Scala.
- Scripting Languages - Used for automating tasks and scripting within software environments.Example: JavaScript, Python, Bash.
- Declarative Languages - Focus on what to do, not how to do it.Example: SQL, HTML (though not strictly programming).
- Markup language -are used to define the structure and presentation of text or data, primarily for documents and web content.Not a programming language.Use tags to annotate or format content.Focus on data structure, not logic or control flow.Example -HTML,XML . 
- Modeling language - Modeling languages are used to visually represent software systems, architecture, or processes. They help in design and analysis before coding.Visual or diagram-based.Describe system components, relationships, and behavior.Often part of software design methodologies.Example - UML . 
- Query language - Query languages are used to retrieve and manipulate data from databases or information systems.Declarative in nature (specify what to retrieve, not how).Focus on data access, filtering, and transformation.Used with structured and semi-structured data.
## Library
A library in software engineering is a collection of pre-written code, functions, classes, or modules that developers can use to perform common tasks without writing code from scratch.
#### Can Be Standard or External

- Standard Libraries: Included with the programming language (e.g., Python’s math, Java’s java.util).

- External Libraries: Developed by third parties and installed separately (e.g., React.js, TensorFlow).

## Framework
A framework is a predefined structure or platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It includes libraries, tools, and guidelines that help streamline and organize development.

### Differnce between a library and a framework 
- Library
  - Control stays with the developer -  You decide when and how to use the library’s functions.

  - Specific functionality -  Libraries are designed to solve specific problems (e.g., data processing, math operations).

  - Plug-and-play -  You can include a library whenever needed without following a strict structure.

  - Flexible usage -  You can use multiple libraries together as you like.

  - Examples - Python: NumPy (for math), Requests (for HTTP) ; JavaScript: Lodash, jQuery





- Framework
  - Control is inverted -  The framework controls the flow and calls your code at specific points (Inversion of Control).

  - Complete structure -  Provides a skeleton or foundation to build an entire application.

  - Opinionated - Often enforces specific design patterns or file structures.

  - Less flexibility -  You have to follow the framework’s rules and structure.

  - Examples - Python: Django, Flask ; JavaScript: Angular, React (React is technically a library but often used like a framework)

## Frontend VS Backend 
- Front-End (Client-Side)
  - What it is -  The part of the software users interact with directly — the user interface (UI).

  - Main focus -  Looks, layout, and behavior of the application in the browser or on the screen.

  - Languages -  HTML (structure), CSS (styling) , JavaScript (interactivity)

  - Frameworks -  React, Angular, Vue.js

  - Responsibility -  Making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.

  - Runs on -  The user’s device (browser or mobile app).
- Back-End (Server-Side)
  - What it is: The behind-the-scenes part that handles logic, databases, and server communication.

  - Main focus: Data processing, server logic, authentication, and database interactions.


  - Languages -  Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby

  - Frameworks -  Django, Express.js, Spring

  - Databases -  MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

  - Responsibility -  Ensuring that the app functions properly and securely behind the scenes.

  - Runs on - The server (cloud or local server).
- How They Work Together
1. The front-end sends requests to the back-end (e.g., when you submit a form).

2. The back-end processes the request, interacts with the database, and sends a response back.

3. The front-end then displays the results to the user.

## Product VS Service 
-  Product 
   - Pre-built Solution -  Designed once and sold/used multiple times without major changes.

   - Scalable -  One product can serve thousands or millions of users.

   - General Purpose -  Built to solve common problems (e.g., MS Office, Photoshop, Zoom).

   - License-Based or Subscription-Based - Revenue comes from selling licenses, subscriptions, or one-time purchases.

   - Less Client Interaction - Developers work based on market research rather than individual client demands.

   - Continuous Updates -  Regular updates are released to add features or fix bugs based on user feedback.

   - Ownership - Owned and controlled by the company or organization that developed it.

   - Example - Microsoft Word, WhatsApp, Google Chrome, Tally, Slack.


- Service 

  - Client-Specific - Tailored to the exact needs and requirements of a particular customer.

  - One-Time or Ongoing Engagement -  Can be a one-time delivery or part of long-term support contracts.

  - Highly Interactive -  Involves constant communication with the client to understand and deliver their requirements.

  - Billing Models -  Usually charged based on time, effort, or project milestones (e.g., hourly, per-project, or retainer-based).

  - Ownership Varies -  The client may own the final software, depending on the contract.

  - Consulting and Support -  Often includes maintenance, updates, and support services.

  - Example - Developing a custom ERP system for a business, building a website for a school, or mobile app development for a startup.

## Saas VS Paas VS Baas (cloud service models)
### 1. Saas (software as a servicve) - provides fully functional, ready-to-use software that runs in the cloud and is accessed via a web browser or app.
- End-user focused: Users simply log in and use the software without worrying about infrastructure or maintenance.

- No installation required - Everything runs online — updates, backups, and server management are handled by the provider.

- Subscription-based - Users usually pay a monthly or yearly fee.

- Multi-tenant - One version of the software serves multiple users/organizations.

- Examples - Gmail, Google Docs, Zoom, Dropbox, Salesforce

- Best for - Businesses and individuals who want easy-to-use tools without technical setup.

### 2. Paas (platform as a service) -  provides a platform or environment for developers to build, test, deploy, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

- Best for - Developers who  want to quickly build mobile or web apps with ready-to-use backend features.

## Cloud computing 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet (the cloud) instead of using your own physical hardware.
- On-Demand Access: You can access resources anytime, anywhere via the internet.

- Pay-as-You-Go: You only pay for what you use (like electricity).

- Scalability: Easily increase or decrease resources as needed (e.g., more storage or processing power).

- No Physical Hardware Needed: You don’t have to buy or maintain servers — cloud providers handle that.

## Architectures 
refers to the high-level structure and design of a software system. It defines how different parts of the system are organized, how they interact, and how they work together to fulfill business or technical goals.

- Types of Software Architecture:
   - Monolithic Architecture - Entire application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit.Entire application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit.

   - Layered Architecture (n-tier) - Divides software into layers like : Presentation Layer (UI), Business Logic Layer , Data Access Layer , Promotes modularity and separation of concerns.


   - Microservices Architecture - Application is broken into small, independent services, each handling a specific business function.
Services communicate through APIs.Great for scalability, flexibility, and continuous deployment.

   - Client-Server Architecture - System is split between : Client (user interface) , Server (processes and stores data) , Common in web apps and enterprise systems.

   - Event-Driven Architecture - Components communicate by sending and reacting to events.Ideal for real-time systems and asynchronous processing.

## DevOps 
DevOps is a combination of two words:
"Development" + "Operations".
It is a set of practices, tools, and cultural principles that aim to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver software faster, more reliably, and more frequently.

## Why DSA is important ?
