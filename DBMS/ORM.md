## What is ORM in DBMS ?

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.
It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systemsâ€”specifically, between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.

## Why ORM is Needed ?

Relational databases store data in tables (rows & columns), while object-oriented programs use objects with properties and methods.
ORM bridges this "impedance mismatch" by mapping database tables to classes, and table rows to objects.

## How ORM Works ?

| Concept in Database | Equivalent in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Table               | Class                                             |
| Row                 | Object                                            |
| Column              | Class attribute/property                         |
| Foreign Key         | Object reference/association                     |
